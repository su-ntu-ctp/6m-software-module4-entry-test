Question 3:

Branch merging is a process wherein code from one branch is merged to another branch. This is particularly useful when feature branches need to be merged to the main codebase. 

Provide the git commands needed to perform the following tasks (Assume that there is a main branch already):

1. Create a new branch called `feature-1`
2. Move to the `feature-1` branch
3. Merge the `feature-1` branch to the main branch
4. Move to the `main` branch
